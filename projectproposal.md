# Project Proposal
## Healthcare Worker Advocacy CRM
### Vision

My vision is to build a simple backend system that manages and reports on nonprofit advocacy data. The goal is to strengthen my skills in database design, backend programming, and working with structured data in a practical and real world setting.

### Motivation
From my experience working with healthcare and union advocacy efforts I know first hand that a large amount of organizing and outreach data is tracked in spreadsheets or manual systems. These tools can be very difficult and time consuming to maintain and they are not ideal at all for coordination or reporting.

I want to build a small and purposeful system that models this work more cleanly while gaining hands on backend development experience.

### Specific Goals
- Design a relational database for members, campaigns, and interactions  
- Implement database models using an ORM (SQLAlchemy)  
- Build backend features and API routes using FastAPI to add, update, delete, and view records    
- Generate summary reports (totals, engagement counts, etc.)  
- Export results to CSV  
- Document setup and weekly progress on my GitHub Pages site  

### Weekly Timeline
- **Weeks 2–3:** Finalize proposal, design database schema/ER diagram, set up project structure and environment  
- **Weeks 4–5:** Implement database models/tables and basic member & campaign features  
- **Weeks 6–7:** Add interaction logging, filtering queries, and basic validation  
- **Weeks 8–9:** Implement reporting logic (totals, summaries, date ranges) and CSV export  
- **Weeks 10–11:** Add testing, error handling, and documentation  
- **Weeks 12–13:** Cleanup, deployment instructions, and final report    

### Risks & Mitigation
- Scope too large → Focus on minimum viable product first  
- Learning new tools → Use simple and well documented frameworks  
- Too much time on UI → Prioritize backend and reporting   

### Project Assessment
- Backend runs locally and connects to the database  
- Records can be created and queried correctly
- API routes respond correctly to requests
- Reports generate accurate summaries  
- Data export works  
- Code and documentation are published
