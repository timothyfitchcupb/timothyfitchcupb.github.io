# Weekly Project Updates

## Week 2 – Project Ideas and Setup

### What did I do last week?
- Reviewed course expectations 
- Explored project ideas in the nonprofit space
- Reflected on instructor feedback suggesting backend focused nonprofit tools
- Set up this GitHub Pages site to document weekly progress

### What do I plan to do this week?
- Select one specific nonprofit focused backend project idea
- Define the project scope / core features
- Begin with the formal project proposal
- Sketch an initial data model and API structure

### Are there any impediments?
- A challenge is choosing a project that is complex enough to learn and demonstrate backend skills that is feasible within the contraints of class

### Reflection
- Helpful nstructor feedback helped to narrow the project toward practical backend systems


## Week 3 - Narrowing scope and Project Proposal 

### What did I Do last week?
- Planned out project ideas, timeline, amd goal more clearly
- Completed project proposal and added it to website

### What do I plan to do this week?
- Identify the core entities and fields needed (members, campaign, interactions, etc)
- Draft a simple diagram (Entity-Relationship)
- Decide on initial backend setup and database choice
- Explore basic implimentation (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite?)

### Are there any impediments?
- Scope creep, already have thought of "extra" ideas before database even close to built
- Keeping focus on learning and implementing basics

### Reflection 
Writing the project proposal this week definitely helped to clarify what is needed and what the timeline will look like. I am excited to get started exploring and implementing these systems.
