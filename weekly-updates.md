# Weekly Project Updates

### Week 2 – Project Ideas and Setup

### What did I do last week?
- Reviewed course expectations 
- Explored project ideas in the nonprofit space
- Reflected on instructor feedback suggesting backend focused nonprofit tools
- Set up this GitHub Pages site to document weekly progress

### What do I plan to do this week?
- Select one specific nonprofit focused backend project idea
- Define the project scope / core features
- Begin with the formal project proposal
- Sketch an initial data model and API structure

### Are there any impediments?
- A challenge is choosing a project that is complex enough to learn and demonstrate backend skills that is feasible within the contraints of class

### Reflection
- Helpful instructor feedback helped to narrow the project toward practical backend systems


### Week 3 - Narrowing scope and Project Proposal 

### What did I Do last week?
- Planned out project ideas, timeline, amd goal more clearly
- Completed project proposal and added it to website

### What do I plan to do this week?
- Identify the core entities and fields needed (members, campaign, interactions, etc)
- Draft a simple diagram (Entity-Relationship)
- Decide on initial backend setup and database choice
- Explore basic implimentation (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite?)

### Are there any impediments?
- Scope creep, already have thought of "extra" ideas before database even close to built
- Keeping focus on learning and implementing basics

### Reflection 
- Writing the project proposal this week definitely helped to clarify what is needed and what the timeline will look like. I am excited to get started exploring and implementing these systems.


### Week 4 - Backend Setup / Initial Implementation

### What did I do last week?
- Researched FastAPI and SQLAlchemy and set up the project structure
- Put together a simple ER diagram to clarify relationships
- Created initial SQLite database and ORM models (Member, Campaign, Interaction)
- Built basic API routes and tested them locally using /docs
- Slight aesthetic tweaks to project website 

### What do I plan to do this week?
- Add CRUD routes for campaigns and interactions
- Insert sample data for testing
- Implement basic filtering queries (by member/campaign)
- Continue further refining models and documenting my progress
- Commit to creating a better time management plan for this project going forward
- Improve aesthetic of project website with stylesheets

### Are there any impediments?
- My biggest impediment so far to this project is time management. I have tried to get better at clocking the hours but sometimes I find myself either getting lost in something or distracted by something else so that it is hard to know exactly how much time I am spending. I have  started using a timer and will continue this going forward. 

### Reflection
Getting the backend running locally made the project feel much more concrete and confirmed that the overall structure is working as intended. I am excited to further flush this out and to build some fun features on top of what I have. I am also excited to flesh out a time management plan that will help me going forward.

### Week 5 — Website Refinement / Database Preparation

### What did I do last week?

Focused mostly on aesthetic improvements and structural updates to the project website  
Spent time refining layout, stylesheets, and overall presentation  
Completed proposal reviews and other class tasks  
Tracked my time more carefully and realized I was going over the intended weekly limit  

### What do I plan to do this week?

Set up a test database environment with sample entries  
Make sure database connectivity and basic functionality are working  
Begin deeper work on database structure and validation  
Continue refining models and documenting progress  

### Are there any impediments?

Time management is still the main impediment  
It’s easy to get stuck tweaking small details and lose track of time  

### Reflection 

Going forward, I plan to use stricter time blocks for each task  

• ~2 hours for website/aesthetic work  
• ~2 hours for database development  
• ~1 hour buffer for anything else that comes up  

This should help keep the project within the weekly time limits while still making steady progress.
