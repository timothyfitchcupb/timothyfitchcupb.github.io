# Weekly Project Updates

## Week 2 – Project Ideas and Setup

### What did I do last week?
- Reviewed course expectations 
- Explored project ideas in the nonprofit space
- Reflected on instructor feedback suggesting backend focused nonprofit tools
- Set up this GitHub Pages site to document weekly progress

### What do I plan to do this week?
- Select one specific nonprofit focused backend project idea
- Define the project scope / core features
- Begin with the formal project proposal
- Sketch an initial data model and API structure

### Are there any impediments?
- A challenge is choosing a project that is complex enough to learn and demonstrate backend skills that is feasible within the contraints of class

### Reflection
- Helpful nstructor feedback helped to narrow the project toward practical backend systems
